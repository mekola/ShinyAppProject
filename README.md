# Shiny App Project - Week 4 Data Products
Course project shiny application and reproducible pitch.

This repo contains the ui.R and server.R files that are used for the shiny data app developed as course work for the week 4 of the data products course. 
A presentation on the project app is available on RPubs: http://rpubs.com/alokem/wordvizapp
The code for the presentation is available in this repo as App1.RPres.

## Get Started
The app is published to shinyapps.io (RStudio Shiny Apps server). To start click onthe link here:

## How it Works
This is a simple app that displays (visualizes) the frequency of words, in a text (file). 
The files being provided can be selected from a drop-down box. For now, some text files have been included as example. It is hoped that in future revs, the user will be able to select and upload their own. 
After selecting the text to process, please make sure you click the 'change" button. It submits your choice.
You can select the frequency of the words using a slider (ranged from 1 to 50). The frequency represent the minimum number of times a word is used in the body of the text.
THe maximum number of words can also be selected using a selection slider. It lets you control the maximum number of words to disply at the selected frequency.

## Purpose
It is hoped that this app will be used in research and analysis of blocks of text. We think it is particularly useful in analyzing speeches and debates. Your favorite political speeches are a prime candidate for the use in this app. For the purpose of a demo a few text files have been included. In future versions, the user will be able to upload their own text files for visualization.
